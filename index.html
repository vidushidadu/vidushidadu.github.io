      <p>

      <p> I am a Systems Research Engineer in the <a href="https://techsysinfra.google/research/">SRG</a> group at Google. I design novel accelerator architectures and interfaces to integrate them in the system-on-chip. </p>

      <p> Prior to Google, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California Los Angeles, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~tjn//">Prof. Tony Nowatzki</a>.  My research is about rethinking the accelerator design to achieve general-purpose acceleration using reconfigurable architecture. My work has been recognized with ACM SIGARCH and IEEE-CS TCCA Outstanding Dissertation Award Honorable Mention, two IEEE Micro Top Picks awards, IEEE Micro Honorable Mention Award and an Outstanding Graduate Student award. </p>
      <p></p> Before joining UCLA, I did my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in Electronics and Communication Engineering with minors in Computer Science (2017). During my undergraduate, I worked with <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/">Prof. Onur Mutlu</a> on designing memory scheduling techniques to mitigate inter-application interference. You can find my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11OcuiXLH63IYCyo_x_MWvyKLKxUu6kr1/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

      <h2> PhD Work </h2> 
	<p> During my PhD, I designed programmable accelerator for irregular workloads, called Sparse Processing Unit (SPU), by finding fundamental data-dependence forms in workloads spanning machine learning, graph processing, and databases. We enhanced SPU's flexibility using "TaskFlow" execution model for supporting fine-grained dynamic parallelism efficiently, making it suitable for graph processing workloads. We proposed PolyGraph accelerators that implements the TaskFlow execution model. My works on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9069252">SPU</a> and <a href="">PolyGraph</a> received IEEE Micro Top Picks Awards which is given to 12 papers in the field each year, based on novelty and the potential for long-term impact. These awards were given for developing a systematic understanding of large hardware-software co-design space. Our recent work, "<a href="">TaskStream</a>: Accelerating Task Parallel Workloads by Recovering Program Structure" develops a unified task-dataflow execution and programming model such that we can program SPU and PolyGraph workloads in TaskStream while exploiting the performance advantage of dynamic work distribution for medium granularity tasks. The <a href="https://dsa-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Basics/index.html">framework</a> for my research is open-source. </p>
      <!-- <p> I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the University of California Los Angeles, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~tjn//">Prof. Tony Nowatzki</a>.  My research is about rethinking the accelerator design to achieve general-purpose acceleration using reconfigurable architecture. My work involves understanding data-processing algorithms concerning the hardware and developing the hardware-software interface to expose their specializable characteristics to the hardware. The <a href="http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~jianw/dsagen/tutorial.html">infrastructure</a> for my research is open-source. </p> -->
      
      <p> During my internships, I gained experience in performance characterization of various industrial architectures -- Configurable Spatial Accelerator (<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/configurable_spatial_accelerator">CSA</a>) at Intel, Edge Tensor Processing Unit (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu">TPU</a>) accelerator for ML at Google, and Microsoft's Azure <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/?OCID=AID2200277_SEM_00cc5053506f160a99be31bfc5aba3be:G:s&ef_id=00cc5053506f160a99be31bfc5aba3be:G:s&msclkid=00cc5053506f160a99be31bfc5aba3be">Synapse</a> Spark for analytical database processing. </p>


	<!--	I am interested in co-designing hardware/software with the goal to ultimately develop efficient general-purpose accelerator, in terms of both performance and energy-efficiency. There is a continuing trend of developing application-specific architectures which are however high performant, they get obsolete with the new algorithm advancements. My research is focused on reconfigurable architectures which provide good promise of generality. I am interested in enhancing their capabilities to support challenging (in terms of their interaction with hardware) workloads using microarchitecture and memory design.  system for Spark During my internship at Intel, I developed memory trace format for spatial architectures and wrote simulator to study memory behaviors of a wide range of accelerator workloads.   </p> -->
