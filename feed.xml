        <title>About</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a third year PhD student at University to California Los Angeles advised by Prof. Tony Nowatzki. I did my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in Electronics and Communication Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am interested in co-designing hardware/software with the goal to ultimately develop efficient general-purpose accelerator, in terms of both performance and energy-efficiency. There is a continuing trend of developing application-specific architectures which are however high performant, they get obsolete with the new algorithm advancements. My research is focused on reconfigurable architectures which provide good promise of generality. I am interested in enhancing their capabilities to support challenging (in terms of their interaction with hardware) workloads using microarchitecture and memory design.&lt;/p&gt;
